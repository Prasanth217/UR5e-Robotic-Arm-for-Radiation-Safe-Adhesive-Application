# **Radiation-Safe UR5e Robotic Arm Simulation**

This repository contains the MATLAB-based simulation framework developed for the **MSc dissertation project**:
*‚ÄúMATLAB-Based Simulation of a UR5e Robotic Arm for Radiation-Safe Adhesive Application in Radiopharmaceutical Packaging.‚Äù*

The project focuses on **radiation-aware path planning** for the UR5e collaborative manipulator, with the goal of automating repetitive packaging tasks while ensuring safety in environments where ionising radiation is present.

## **Features**

* UR5e robot modelled in MATLAB using Robotics System Toolbox.
* Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver with multiple seed configurations.
* Joint-space interpolation for smooth motion.
* Obstacle avoidance using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB).
* Radiation zone detection using spherical exclusion regions.
* Multi-view (2√ó2 subplot) visualisation of robot, obstacles, and radiation zones.
* Performance evaluation across multiple simulation trials.
